# 🌸 How to Add Your Custom Goddess Parvathi Image

## Option 1: Public Folder (Easiest)

1. Place your image file in: `client/public/goddess-parvathi.jpg`
2. The app will automatically detect and use it!

## Option 2: Assets Folder

1. Create folder: `client/src/assets/` (if it doesn't exist)
2. Place your image: `client/src/assets/goddess-parvathi.jpg`
3. Refresh the page

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Square format recommended (500x500px or larger)
- **Name**: `goddess-parvathi.jpg` (or .png/.webp)

## File Structure Examples

### Option 1 (Public folder):

```
client/
├── public/
│   ├── goddess-parvathi.jpg  👈 Put your image here
│   └── index.html
├── src/
└── package.json
```

### Option 2 (Assets folder):

```
client/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── goddess-parvathi.jpg  👈 Or here
│   ├── components/
│   └── ...
├── public/
└── package.json
```

## What Happens

- ✅ If your image is found: Your custom Goddess image appears
- ✅ If image not found: Beautiful placeholder image is used
- ✅ No errors or warnings in either case!

## Different Image Name?

If you want to use a different filename like `parvathi.jpg` or `goddess.png`, just let me know and I'll update the code to match your filename.
